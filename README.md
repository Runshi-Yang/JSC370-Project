# Examining the factors affecting the occurrence of KSI

## About the Project

This was completed as a final project for the course "JSC370: Data Science II" at the University of Toronto. 

## Project Motivation & Description 

Traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of injury and death worldwide. Despite significant advances intransportation safety technology, road traffic accidents remain a serious public health concern. In Canada,traffic accidents result in thousands of injuries and fatalities each year, with many of these accidents occurringin the city of Toronto. [Toronto Police Service Open Data Portal](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca) offers a Traffic Collisions - Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) Dataset,containing detailed information on all traffic collision events in Toronto from 2006 to 2022. This dataset provides comprehensive information that canhelp stakeholders gain a better understanding of the causes and consequences of traffic accidents in the city.  

The purpose of this report is to investigate the factors that contribute to serious traffic accidents in Toronto. The analysis will focus on identifying the contributing factors to incidents resulting in death or serious injury, including geographic location, environmental factors and demographic characteristics of drivers. The findings of this report will help policymakers, transportation planners, and other stakeholdersto develop effective policies and interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of serious traffic accidents.
